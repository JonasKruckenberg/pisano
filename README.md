## About

Pisano lets you explore different visualizations of [Pisano periods], repeating integer sequences closes related to [Fibonacci numbers].

Pisano Periods are integer sequences derived by taking other integer sequences modulo some constant ( $n$ ). For the Fibonacci numbers ( $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368$ ) and modulo $n = 3$ the corresponding pisano period starts like this:

<div>

$$ 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, $$

</div

If you then take $n$ equally spaced points on a circle a draw lines between them according to the pisano period you get this visualisation:

## Disclaimer

I made this while I was supposed to work on a talk. **This is a procrastination project!** There is much work left here, including bug fixes, adding new sequences, adding new visualizations etc. but let's hope for my talk's sake I will not implement these features! If you are interested in adding these, feel free to open a PR and I will be happy to merge it!

## Contributing

This project uses [pnpm] as its package manager and [sveltekit] as its frontend framework.

### Developing

Once you have installed the dependencies with `pnpm install` you can start the app in development mode:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```
