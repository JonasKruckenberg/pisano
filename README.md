## Disclaimer

I made this while I was supposed to work on a talk. **This is a procrastination project!** There is much work left here, including bug fixes, adding new sequences, adding new visualizations etc. but let's hope for my talk's sake I will not implement these features! If you are interested in adding these, feel free to open a PR and I will be happy to merge it!
